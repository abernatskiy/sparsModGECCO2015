A collection of scripts for modularity evaluation 
which uses the Fast Community Unfolding algorithm 
(http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476) in its original 
implementation by authors
(https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/) 
to compute Q values of EVS-compartible networks.

The suite works on Linux and perhaps on MacOS.

-----

USAGE:

Download the "updated" version of the code from 
the site:

wget -O community.tgz "https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/newversion/community.tgz"

unzip in the repo folder. Compile 
the code (adding "#include <unistd.h>" at the top 
of main_community.cpp may be helpful). Create the 
necessary pipes by running

$ ./makePipes.sh

After that, sequences of lines in the format

<id0> <weights0>
<id1> <weights1>
...

can be piped through the script massQ.sh to yield

<id0> <q0>
<id1> <q1>
...

For now, the app only works with Espinosa-Soto Wagner 
style boolean networks.
