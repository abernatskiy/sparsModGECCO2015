ESWClient - Espinosa-Soto Wagner -style boolean network evaluator

This application serves as a client to EVolutionary Server (EVS),
which takes genomes of the boolean networks as its input and returns
their fitness values as output. The networks and fitness evaluation 
procedures are identical to the ones described in the Espinosa-Soto
Wagner 2010 paper (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000719).
